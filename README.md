# delete-duplicated-hubspot-leads
 
We are all glad that HubSpot recently launched the lead object, but unfortenately it doesn't have all the basic features of other objects at this point in time, such as an index page to filter and bulk delete duplicated leads.

Running this Python program will find and delete duplicated leads. Only the first lead created for a contact will remain.
